Organize your Page Builder Templates in the WordPress Admin. Better overview, don't get lost. Time saver. With extended plugin & theme support.


## Description 

Organize your Page Builder Templates in the WordPress Admin. Time saver, especially for bigger projects. Get a better and faster overview, don't get lost. Filter templates with your categories. With extended plugin & theme support.

Out of the box the plugin includes integrations for a lot of awesome Page Builders, Themes and Plugins. If any supported integration is installed & active, the "Builder Template Categories" plugin just applies its additions. The plugin is really lightweight and simple. Just activate and you're done - and can use the categorization.


### What the Plugin does? 
- **Better organize** your templates if you have many of them
- **Better overview** for admins and site builders
- **Filtering** in the overview table of a post type (typical WordPress overview) via Dropdown Filter, or Link filter in the row of a post type's post
- Only for admins, within the admin - a great helper tool
- No frontend, no scripts, no styles - nothing! :-)
- Lightweight, efficient
- Developer friendly: clean code, inline documentation, lots of filters available


### Typical Use Case of this Plugin 
You are building a **big site** with **lots of different templates** across **various template libraries** of different plugins.
Now the "Builder Template Categories" plugin helps you organize those templates better and more efficiently. For example you have a template category "Landing Pages".
This category is now visible in Elementor's "My Templates", as well as in the Theme "GeneratePress" and its "Elements" Module, as well as in "PopBox for Elementor" plugin and also in "Pods" plugin's "Templates".

So in every one of those libraries you can now filter and list all parts of templates for this specific post type that belong to your "Landing Pages" category.

Please note: The categories are global but when filtering only those items are listed that are connected to the specific post type. [See the FAQ for more info on that](https://wordpress.org/plugins/builder-template-categories/#faq)

### This Plugin ...

## Installation 


### Minimum Requirements 

* WordPress version 4.7 or higher
* PHP version 5.6 or higher
* MySQL version 5.0 or higher
* Administrator user with capability `edit_theme_options`


### We Recommend Your Host Supports at least: 

* PHP version 7.0 or higher
* MySQL version 5.6 or higher / or MariaDB 10 or higher


### Installation 

1. Install using the WordPress built-in Plugin installer (via **Plugins > Add New** - search for `builder template categories`), or extract the ZIP file and drop the contents in the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to your already active plugin or theme which has the template library and you'll see the additional template category as a new submenu item (for example: "Template Categories").
4. Now enjoy organizing your templates, get better overview and save time ;-)


## Frequently Asked Questions 

**Why is the taxonomy "global" and applied to more than one post type?**
The answer is simple: Our taxonomy is only for organizing purposes if you have to manage many, many templates. It is easy to just enter 2 or more different categories if you use more than one of the supported integrations (and therefore have our taxonomy applied to more than one post type).

It would add a lot of bloat to register a "organizing taxonomy" for every supported post type of an integration. This really makes absolutely no sense in my opinion. Of course, you are free to tweak the behavior of the plugin with the built-in filters or WordPress Core functions, filters, actions and classes. Plus, you can at any time easily register any custom taxonomy yourself.

This plugin here is a "quick and easy" solution: install, activate, organize with categories. Done.

**The category counter displays wrong number?**
The counter works fine, really.
The "issue" you're seeing is most likely that: you have more than one of the supported integrations active. Therefore the categories are global and applied to each of the integrations. But the terms count for the categories remains also global.

*Example:*

* Example Category: "Landing Pages"
* for "Landing Pages" - Count in "Elementor My Templates": 5
* for "Landing Pages" - Count in "Astra Custom Layouts": 10

The term **counter** in the **taxonomy list table** will always display: **15**. This is the **global term count**.

Continuing the example: When filtering in "Elementor My Templates" for "Landing Pages" you will get 5 results. Which is fully correct. These are the 5 results that are connected to *this* post type. The same filter in "Astra Custom Layouts" will bring 10, of course, as only these 10 terms are connected to *this* Layouts Post Type. And so on...! :)

**Why is the Administrator Role recommended?**
This plugin only works and makes sense for Administrator users just because the post types it integrates with are mostly only accessable for administrators. The target user group of this plugin are site builders, admins, developers who want to organize their admin area better, plus their website projects.

To customize the capability to make the taxonomy appear in the Admin Dashboard you can use a filter:
```
add_filter( 'btc/filter/capability/submenu', 'btc_custom_capability_submenu' );
/**
 * Plugin: Builder Template Categories - Custom capability.
 */
function btc_custom_capability_submenu() {

	return 'edit_posts';

}  // end function
```

**Is Elementor required for this plugin?**
Elementor (free) is not required. But once it is installed and active the integration gets loaded, meaning, the taxonomy for categorizing Elementor templates appears (My Templates Library). This will make organizing templates a breeze ;-)

I totally [recommend Elementor](https://toolbarextras.com/go/elementor/) - so, with it active, this plugin here will make the perfect sense!

**Is Elementor Pro required for this plugin?**
Absolutely not. For the Elementor integration the free version of Elementor is enough as it already adds the template library ("My Templates").

However, I [strongly recommend Elementor Pro](https://toolbarextras.com/go/elementor-pro/) as it is so useful for Non-Coder Designers site builders.

**Where are the other popular Page Builders?**
All the others already have template categories by default, or, on the other hand, cannot be supported with a post type taxonomy.

* Beaver Builder & Beaver Themer: has template categories by default
* Thrive Architect: has category feature built-in
* Divi: has template categories by default
* Brizy: has no template library yet

**Will other Themes be supported?**
Yes, absolutely. – Once I discover another theme (or via an add-on plugin) which adds a template library but has no categories for organizing I consider adding an integration. Of course, you can also make me aware of other themes and plugins with such libraries.

**Will other third-party Plugins be supported?**
Yes, absolutely. - Once I discover another plugin which adds a template library but has no categories for organizing I consider adding an integration. Of course, you can also make me aware of other themes and plugins with such libraries.

**Will this Plugin slow down my site?**
Absolutely not. The plugin will only do its stuff for logged-in Administrator users. It does nothing for visitors of your site. Plugin loads its stuff only when needed and if supported theme/ plugin is active. Plugin was built to be as lightweight as possible.

**Does the Plugin work with Multisite?**
Yes, it works fine in Multisite, you could even activate it Network-wide. However, the taxonomy is only added on a per site basis (if the supported integrations are active). Therefore it makes the most sense to activate the plugin on a per site basis.

**Can I extend or customize the plugin?**
Yes, of course.
There are numerous filters built-in, plus the default filters for taxonomies from WordPress Core apply.

If you want to add support for your own custom library, just declare the following register statement via our filter:
```
add_filter( 'btc/filter/integrations/all', 'ddw_btc_register_integration_popup_maker' );
/**
 * Plugin: Builder Template Categories - Register custom integration.
 *
 * @param  array $integrations Holds array of all registered integrations.
 * @return array Tweaked array of registered integrations.
 */
function ddw_btc_register_integration_popup_maker( array $integrations ) {

	$post_type = 'your-post-type';

	$submenu_hook = 'your-custom-settings-page';	// as in: your-site.domain/wp-admin/admin.php?page=your-custom-settings-page;
	// or alternative: $submenu_hook = 'edit.php?post_type=' . $post_type;

	$template_label = 'template';	// or: library, layout, element, popup, lightbox, block, listing

	$integrations[ 'your-custom-handle-lowercase' ] = array(
		'label'          => __( 'My Custom Templates', 'your-textdomain' ),
		'submenu_hook'   => $submenu_hook,
		'post_type'      => $post_type,
		'template_label' => $template_label,
		'admin_url'      => 'edit.php?post_type=' . $post_type,
	);

	return $integrations;

}  // end function
```

Best practice is to wrapp the whole code above in a conditional to check if the theme/ plugin/ post type is active before applying anything from our "Builder Template Categories" stuff.

* German (de_DE): Deutsch - immer dabei! :-)
* For custom and update-safe language files please upload them to `/wp-content/languages/builder-template-categories/` (just create this folder) - This enables you to use fully custom translations that won't be overridden on plugin updates. Also, complete custom English wording is possible with that as well, just use a language file like `builder-template-categories-en_US.mo/.po` to achieve that (for creating one see the following tools).
