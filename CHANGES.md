* New: Integration with Page Builder plugin Themify Builder (Premium, by Themify) - note: this applies only to the premium version of this plugin
* New: Integration with plugin JetPopup (free, by Zemez Jet/ CrocoBlock)

* New: If WooCommerce template related integrations are active before plugin installation/activation add predefined "Products" term
* New: If Popup/Modal template related integrations are active before plugin installation/activation add predefined "Popups" term
* New: In post type list tables for bulk actions the "Edit" label was tweaked to "Edit, add Category etc." to make it more clear for users that template categories (of this plugin) can be added as well in bulk mode
* New: Added help tab with additional info - appearing on the plugin's taxonomy page as well as all edit screens from post types of any active integration
* New: Added a new screenshot to show Bulk Actions - to add template category to more than one template in one action
* New: Created special [Facebook Group for user community support](https://www.facebook.com/groups/deckerweb.wordpress.plugins/) for all plugins from me (David Decker - DECKERWEB), this one here included! ;-) - [please join at facebook!](https://www.facebook.com/groups/deckerweb.wordpress.plugins/)
